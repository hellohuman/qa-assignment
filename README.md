# QA Take-Home Assignment

A small take-home assignment for QA candidates to demonstrate working knowledge of web user interface and API testing.

## User interface testing

Use the publicly available [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/) sample to create a suite of manual and automated tests that show some of:
* Sign up of a new user
* User login
* *Global Feed* loading progress and final state
* Navigation to an article
* Creation of a new article

Note that whatever password you use on this site should be considered insecure, and you should not rely on existing records or accounts as they may be removed at any time.

The choice of what is automated vs. manual and how many tests to create is up to the candidate. It should be guided by the idea that this is to showcase that you can:
* Create automated tests that run against the user interface and report their results
* Store the automated tests in a Github repository
* Document the automated tests with sufficient detail for others to be able to run them
* Create manual tests with sufficient documentation for others to replicate them and achieve the same results

The candidate should also think about and suggest improvements to the application. This task is deliberately open ended and 5-10 suggestions is sufficient, however areas such as handling of error cases, consistency/quality of user experience, and potential security or system attack risks should be considered.

## API testing
